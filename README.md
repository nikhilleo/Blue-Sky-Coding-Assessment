### What was the most challenging part?
- Challenging part was data cleaning and mapping the gases to proper name.
### What was the most fun part?
- Fun part was using Python, Pandas to clean the data and also writing all the data in database using Python, also I had never tried to use the .env variables in the notebook. So I learned something new in the assignment.
### What do you think is wrong with this task or could be made better in this task?
- I think the task was good. To make it better it would have been great to add some more APIs to build.
